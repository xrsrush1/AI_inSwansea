# AI_inSwansea

**Description:** 
This project focuses on AI driven non-player character (NPC) interaction. The goal of this project is to create an immersive and user-friendly virtual reality or mixed reality experience to evoke a strong sense of presence within the virtual or real world. I chose to create a mixed reality experience to explore the features of the latest Meta Quest 3 headset and integrated AI in it. I implemented NPCâ€™s that can be interacted with via a dialogue system. The dialogue system gives a range of different choices to the user and lead to different outcomes in a coherent storyline.
